       <li>
         Every Js object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance
         possible in Js
       </li>
       <br />
       <li>
         The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and
         properies that we want other objects to inherit
       </li>
       <br />
       <li>
         The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the
         constructor itself, it’s the prototype of ALL instances that are created
         through it
       </li>
       <br />
       <li>
         When a certain method or property is called, the search starts in the
         object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the
         object’s prototype. This continues until the method is found: prototype
         chain
       </li>
